# Peer production adaptation——WikiHouse

## Abstract
WikiHouse is an open source project to reinvent the way people make homes. It is being developed by architects, designers, engineers, inventors, manufacturers and builders, collaborating to develop the best, simplest, most sustainable, high-performance building technologies, which anyone can use and improve (“about”, 2018). This paper explores the WikiHouse from the perspective of peer production, describes the collaboration infrastructure and also identifies the challenge faced by the adaptation of WikiHouse in an open source way. 

## Key word
WikiHouse, open source, peer production

## Introduction
Peer production is on the rise as a new pathway of value creation, Free and open source software is the great example of it. However, Open source has long existed not only in the software world, "open source hardware" is making the "factory" everywhere. The open source movement isn’t only revolutionizing technology and how we share things; it also promises to transform the way we design, construct and interact with our buildings and open source is being applied to more crazy areas. Alastair Parvin is an architect from the UK and is also the person who promoted WikiHouse. He found that the smartest and best designers and architects can only work for the richest people in the world. The challenge for the next generation of designers is how to contribute their own designs to more people. Whether it is poverty or wealth. The WikiHouse platform was born under this idea.  Since WikiHose is still at a starting stage, this paper explores the current condition of the WikiHouse and analyzes the efforts of WikiHouse to adapt peer production.
