# How Far Can Mappers Go along the Open Source Way? A Brief Look at OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap(OSM) is an initiative to create and provide free geographic data, such as street maps, to anyone (OpenStreetMap Foundation, 2017). Inspired by Wikipedia and the predominance of proprietary map data, OSM is created in the UK in 2004 (“OpenStreetMap”, Wikipedia) and addresses itself as “the Free Wiki World Map” (OpenStreetMap Forum, n.d.). As an editable open data common, it now has over two million worldwide users as an active community of mappers that voluntarily contribute and maintain geographic information on OSM. As a knowledge production community, OSM has mobilized a large, geographically dispersed population of users to work toward a shared database. In the following section, the contribution and organization process of this productive enterprise will be uncovered to demonstrate the hybrid collaborative style of OSM.
##	Why people use OSM?

The whole story starts at the first-time engagement in the OSM by individual users. Surely it can be plenty of fun to create and edit a web map, but OSM is primarily an open, rich geodata source and supports various uses. For instance, users can download geospatial data or maps, display them on their own websites, use them in GPS devices or as raw materials for creative work.  Free editing is allowed so users can tailor and edit the map data for their own ends. An intuitive example from daily practice could be that the author uses OSM to mark her favorite cafes on OSM. In essence, OSM serves as a relatively plain base map and gets further enriched by user-generated map content. These contents include observed geographical features, like locations, rivers, roads, buildings, shops, amenities, transport, etc. and multidimensional information about their attributes. OSM claims data collection through such collective efforts leads to better accuracy. Contrast with map data from public domain or commercial sources, newly crowd-collected geographic information is more updated and free of intentionally distorted information created by original author in case of copyright disputes.
According to a long-term OSM user, many people use OSM for research purposes. Academics from various disciplinary backgrounds, like archeology, architecture, history, geology, and civil engineering, etc., come to OSM for its use value. As the observed result, the OSM user community also consists of GIS professionals, enthusiasts like hikers and cyclers, humanitarians mapping disaster-affected areas, as well as businesses and government agencies. Most of their motivations for using and editing map data are nonmonetary, self-directed and maybe for the instrumental value (Deci & Ryan, 2000), while some humanitarian mappers may be involved in crisis mapping practice out of altruism. The interviewed user also did not deny that there are hobbyists who purely enjoy the fun of playing with editable web maps.

###	OSM as an open data common
###	Heterogenous motivations

##	How to contribute?
###	Three-way contribution via various platform: edit, upload, import
###	Use geographic data
###	Rewindability
####	Changeset rollback
####	Editing history

##	Once the work is done
###	Licensing
###	Distribution

##	How to collaborate
###	Assorted communication infrastructure
####	Changeset discussion
###	Decentralized task conceptualization & execution
####	Algorithmic vs. human decision-making processes
####	Task design framed by objects & technology


* Summary:
1) material characteristic of geographic data: rich forms and formats
2) affordance of sets of technology/periphery/infrastructure
3)	a sociotechnical system
