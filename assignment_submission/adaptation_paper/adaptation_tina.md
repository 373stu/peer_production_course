Manuel, the Magnificent Mechanic Man – an “open novel” inspired by the “open source way”

“Manuel, the Magnificent Mechanic Man” is an “open novel”, created in 2013 by Juan Julián Merelo Guervós (Merelo) and posted on GitHub.

According to its GitHub page, the novel is a “dieselpunk novel with Spanish-created robot hobos kicking sawdust in the circus in a balcanized America at the beginning of the XXth century” (https://jj.github.io/hoborg/). It is situated in Florida which became a multiracial socialist independent state after the US was defeated by technologically superior Cuba and Spain (ibid).

The novel is 72 pages long, was created over a period of a few months. The text was written in Markdown, is published on GitHub and can be edited, starred (= saved in a repository) and/or forked. The license chosen for the novel is a free license. It was published on Amazon as a Kindle edition on August 13, 2013 (https://www.amazon.com/Manuel-Magnificent-Mechanical-Logical-Natural-History-ebook/dp/B00ED084BK/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Manuel+the+magnificent&qid=1571170136&sr=8-1).

The novel is inspired by the “open source software model” and peer production projects. The main inspiration for open source projects came from the author’s previous work. Merelo is a professor for Computer Technology at the University of Granada in Spain (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juan_Merelo_Guervos). He has been involved in the free software movement from the beginning, so it made sense to him to use open source ways (Morelo, JJ, Email). Besides this novel, he has written several other open source books, mostly technical books (https://www.amazon.com/Juan-J.-Merelo-Guerv%C3%B3s/e/B006K92NX2/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0).

The way Merelo wrote this book is in many aspects identical or similar to the open source software model. What constitutes Open source can be defined in different ways. Most definitions come from software concepts, but the “open source way” has also been used for projects that adapt the open source way beyond software.

A short definition of open source software comes from Opensource.com. According to this website it is “software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.” (Opensource.com, What is Open Source?).

While open source is usually connected to software, it is not limited to this use. The base of Merelo’s book is its text, just like the base of a software is its code. While some might argue that text is different from code (see discussion in the online forum Open Source on Stackexchange.com), Merelo’s text can be modified in any way, very similar to code in software. It can be inspected, modified and enhanced just like code. Even the way chosen by Merelo, to do it through Git-commands, is similar to coding. Thus, this “open novel” can be seen as very similar to open source software.

A more general definition found on the open source guides website that moves away from the software industry and describes the “open source way”, is that a project can be considered open source if  “anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute the project for any purpose and the permissions are enforced through an open source license” (Open Source guides, Starting an Open Source Project).

Merelo’s book is freely accessible through the internet. It can be used in various ways, as it can be read, modified or forked. The original or the forks can also be widely and freely distributed. Finally, he also created an open source license in form of a free license. Thus, the usual components that characterize the open source way can all be seen in this novel.

Additional characteristics of open source projects, can be found at the Website “Opensource.com” which is published by the Red Hat Company. The main principles of the “open source way” there are “transparency, collaboration, early and multiple releases, meritocracy, and community” (Opensource.com. The open source way).

Each of these elements can be found in Merelo’s book.

The writing process is completely transparent. Everything can be followed on GitHub and the author gives explanations for any changes. Proposed changes are documented. The author comments on each proposed change and his reasoning for accepting or rejecting the change.

The author invites collaboration with anybody who wants to participate. He offers participation through GitHub, or if the user would prefer another method, he is open to other means of communication, like email.

The novel only has only one release. However, this is due to the lack of response and not due to not being open to more releases.

The aspect of meritocracy is also present. The author quickly acknowledges mistakes and does not mind being corrected. However, when it comes to style it seems that he often believes that his original word choice might be superior. The contributors do not really challenge these responses and there are not usually other contributors involved in deciding on such conflicts. This is due to the lack of responses and not really because of a lack of acceptance of discourse.

The community involved is completely open. Contributors come from different parts of the world and nobody is excluded. The author notes that he doesn’t know much about the contributors but noticed some participation due to class projects (Merelo, Interview).

Overall, it seems therefore that this particular “open novel” also incorporates almost all of the key elements of the open source way found on the “Opensource.com”-Website.

According to all of the above-mentioned definitions, Merelo’s novel would qualify as an open source model.

Merelo’s novel can also be seen as inspired by peer production, which according to Benkler is the “most significant organizational innovation that has emerged from Internet-mediated social practice” (Benkler, 2013, p.1), and by open collaboration principles.

Levine and Prietula describe such collaborative efforts as characterized by “relying on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants, who interact to create products of economic value, which they then offer to anyone” (Levine &Prietula, 2015, p. 1415). Tapscott in Wikinomics similarly points out, that Peer Production relies in its purest form “entirely on self-organizing, egalitarian communities of individuals who come together voluntarily to produce a shared outcome” (Tapscott et al., 2011, p. 67).

However, not all of the concepts completely fit this novel. The raw structure was organized by the author Merelo, but the individual contribution is not treated completely equal, as the author needs to approve changes to the master document. Tapscott points out, that in reality most peer productions mix elements of hierarchy and self-organization (Tapscott et al., 2011, p. 67). This is also the case in this novel. There is a certain hierarchy as the author decides alone on changes, but there is also self-organization as users can create their own forks.

The other elements are fulfilled. The participants come together voluntarily and produce (at least in theory) a shared outcome, the finished book/books that are free for everyone.

The infrastructure and process of writing the book also very much resembles other peer production projects through its forms of open collaboration, and its license. Hereinafter, the process will be described in more detail to illustrate the collaborative structure of the project.

Merelo put his draft of the novel into GitHub, provided a list of “To Do” items for future contributors and invites everyone to add, edit and fork as they like. Edits or added text are submitted through commits and pull requests.

This GitHub site was created in 2013. It shows that the project has 8 contributors, 355 commits in total (the last one in 2018), two branches and over 60 forks. The author published a couple of web blogs explaining the process. He has a twitter account for the novel with 120 followers (https://twitter.com/Hoborg_Novel) and a Facebook page with 48 likes (https://www.facebook.com/ManuelTheMagnificent/). The twitter account automatically reports all changes by using GitHub service hooks to send commits to the Hoborg Twitter account (Merelo (2013) Rigging GitHub). He also used a continuous integration tool, Travis, to test his text and revised his text accordingly (Merelo, Interview; Merelo, Email).

The initial commit was on May 25th, 2013, the first commits from outsiders happened on January, 2015. While the author usually quickly accepted grammar changes, he did not equally change the style as he was not convinced that the proposed changes would make the novel better. In the pull request notes he would comment on why he picked a particular word and did not like the proposed change (https://github.com/JJ/hoborg/pulls). Overall, there were more forks than actual changes to the original text – except from the author himself. Of the 355 commits, 331 came from the author himself (https://github.com/JJ/hoborg/graphs/contributors), the last one from 2018 (in which he just cleaned up data) The forks did not merge back to the original text. Changes and roadmaps are posted on GitHub with comments. After a few months he published a copy as a Kindle book and now sells it for $ 1 on Amazon with the invitation to further work with the book if people desire to do so. A free version of the text is available on GitHub (http://jj.github.io/hoborg/text/text.)

The novel was published on GitHub under a free license as free software that can “be redistributed and/or modified as Perl itself” (https://github.com/JJ/hoborg/blob/master/Text-Hoborg/README).

All of this shows a collaborative structure seen in peer projects.

The author checks from time to time the progress on those forks but is not aware of how many actually continued to write their version until the end (Merelo, Interview).

During the process of writing the novel, the author faced several challenges. The main one was that there were not many contributions. He admits that his own contributions made up about 99% of all contributions (Merelo, Interview, Merelo Email). His “To do” list is still not done. It contained 14 items, only one is crossed off by himself (“Revise it Thoroughly”). The sales have also been very modest according to the author. Overall, he sold just about 2 -3 copies (Merelo, interview).

While the author admits that the feedback to his novel was “underwhelming” and he still waits “for a Hollywood agent to knock on his door” (Merelo, Email), he stays committed to continue writing open source books. For him it is the best way to publish books and he will continue to do so. He has written several other books, mostly, however, non-fiction computer science books about programming. The non-fiction books have been much more successful compared to the novel. The author concludes that maybe novels in general are more difficult to sell (Merelo, Interview). Books about coding might also be more adept to the open-source model. He reports that often contributors revise his technical statements if they see an error or add description (Merelo, Interview). In that way, the open source editing of a computer science book can almost be seen as an “open source software” itself.

Researching the internet one can find a few other “open novels” https://github.com/opensourcenovel/opensourcenovel/blob/master/README.md
https://projectshadow.com/open-source-fiction. More can be found in GitHub. A selection of open source books is also listed on an open forum about Writing (Stackexchange open forum about Writing). However, in general, it does not seem to be a huge market.

Overall, open novels are not yet a widely accepted form of literature. One of the problems could be that writing is just too personal. Everybody has different story ideas, styles and ways to write which might mix easier in non-fiction than in fiction. The author mentioned that to his surprise several contributors wanted to change the beginning of his story, which he didn’t approve (Merelo, Interview). This can definitely be seen as a difference in style that is hard to resolve. However, even in fiction writing an open source way can be successful in exchanging story ideas. The fact that the novel did not have any major changes by contributors but over 60 people forked the novel shows that at least the story plot can take off a life on its own and be successful.

The idea of an “open book” in non-fiction, in contrast, seems to be much more successful and promises to be a fruitful way of collaboration in the spirit of peer production. It is especially suitable for programming related content. It is most likely a more successful way to publish books the “open source way” compared to publishing “open novels”.
