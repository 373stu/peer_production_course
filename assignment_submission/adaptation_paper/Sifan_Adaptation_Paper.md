# Case Study: The Adaptation of HUST Online Judge
#### Instructor: James Howison
#### Student: Sifan Guo

## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 People Who Started This Project
About 10 years ago in 2008, _Sempr_, a former member of Huazhong University of Science and Technology(  [HUST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology)) [ACMICPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) team, had an idea of building an [online judge][1] both for their team's algorithm training and for his own graduation project. Although many successful projects are created by a single person, more people are needed in order to perfect them. According to one former participant Shang(my interviewee), before _Sempr_ began coding, he discussed this idea with his teammates and their team's advisors, undoubtedly, they all encouraged him to fulfill it and they promised to offer help when needed. Through the efforts of all these people, the HUST Online Judge first came out with the domain acm.hust.edu.cn which was no longer used after Jan 2018 due to many reasons.

### 1.2 Embracing the Wonderful GPL v2 License!
It was no later than a week after HUSTOJ started its service when the team decided to share their codes on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hustoj/) under the GNU General Public License, version 2. Shang told me that their team made this decision for many reasons:

1. Their teammates were all busy training and the fact that they were good at algorithms doesn't necessarily mean they were capable of programming. They all agreed that they could turn to more people for help.

2. The online judge was good enough for them, and they want more users to join and offer feedbacks because more people would have more different viewpoints which could help them to improve the online judge in various ways.

3. Most contributors of this project were senior students, and they were afraid of being too busy to contribute after the graduation.

4. As mentioned in the second reason, they thought highly of their online judge, so they wanted to share their codes with the world and "show off".

5. The staff of HUST considered it as a great way to expand the influence of the university, also, this can be counted as their working achievements.

### 1.3 Becoming Popular
As more and more universities began to have teams for ACMICPC, they attached great significance to building their own online judge system because they can customize the system and flexibly host their own competitions. Including many high schools, 126 organizations (most of them are universities: [check the whole list here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hustoj/)) throughout the world had used the HUST Online Judge or designed their own system based on it. According to Shang, HUST Online Judge was well-known to domestic ACMICPC teams then. In a word, it was definitely a successful project around 2010.


### 1.4 Without the Domain hust.edu.cn, What Would HUST Online Judge Be?
After Jan 2018, the origin domain acm.hust.edu.cn was no longer used after nearly 10 years of service. There are two websites -- [hustoj.org](http://www.hustoj.org) and [hustoj.com](http://www.hustoj.com/), both of them claimed to be HUST Online Judge but neither provides the real judging service as acm.hust.edu.cn used to. The hustoj.org offers English version and works as a backup which retains the original data but submission hasn't been enabled yet. On the other hand, hustoj.com does provide demo submission and judge service, however, unlike non-profit service, it seems to be a commercial website which is [selling the customer service][2].

I asked Shang why the domain was changed and he indicated that it's the university's decision. In addition, he said we can't know the real reasons which made the university decide not to offer her domain and servers anymore. I tried to contact the staff but no one responded, as a result, what I'm going to say are all based on my conjecture, **please don't hesitate to let me know by pulling request or adding issues, if anyone has the other stories of HUST Online Judge. I'll be more than happy to update this paper in no time.**

After in-depth discussion with Shang, we both agreed the commercialization of HUST Online Judge would be direct cause. In most Chinese universities, they are only allowed to offer online services or other alike resources to their students for academic use only, otherwise things would become too complicated because applying for commercial projects requires approval of many departments of the university. In other words, if we're making money by using resources of the organization without supervision, it's like cheating. Case in point, an active contributor of HUST Online Judge and also the administrator of hustoj.com _zhblue_ is selling his service. Although _zhblue_ is not from HUST, he did play an irreplaceable role in promoting HUST Online Judge by offering paid service. Because even though the HUST ACMICPC team shared their codes online, many organizations still have problems configuring their own machines, under those circumstances, _zhblue_'s service came in handy.

However Shang and I believed that _zhblue_'s service is legitimate business practices and it's beyond reproach, the fact that _zhblue_ doesn't belong to HUST and he's taking advantages of HUST's brand effect made the staff of HUST feel bad. I guess those who were feeling bad made the decision of removing acm.hust.edu.cn off their official hust.edu.cn domain.
