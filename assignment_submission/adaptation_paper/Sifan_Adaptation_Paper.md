# The Dilemma of Peer Production Inside A University

## Introduction
### People Who Started This Project
About 10 years ago in 2008, Sempr, a former member of [HUST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology) [ACMICPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) team, had an idea of building an online judge both for their team's algorithm training and for his own graduation project. Although many successful projects are created by a single person, more people are needed in order to perfect them. According to one former participant Shang(my interviewee), before Sempr began coding, he discussed this idea with his teammates and their team's advisors, undoubtedly, they all encouraged him to fulfill it and they promised to offer help when needed. Through the efforts of all these people, the HUST Online Judge first came out with the domain acm.hust.edu.cn which was no longer used after Jan 2018 due to many reasons.

### Embracing GPLv2!
It was no later than a week after HUSTOJ started its service when the team decided to share their codes on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hustoj/). Shang told me that their team made this decision for many reasons:

1. Their teammates were all busy training and the fact that they were good at algorithms doesn't necessarily mean they were capable of programming. They all agreed that they could turn to more people for help.

2. The online judge was good enough for them, and they want more users to join and offer feedbacks because more people would have more different viewpoints which could help them to improve the online judge in various ways.

3. Most contributors of this project were senior students, and they were afraid of being too busy to contribute after the graduation.

4. As mentioned in the second reason, they thought highly of their online judge, so they wanted to share their codes with the world and "show off".

5. The staff of HUST considered it as a great way to expand the influence of the university.



It was a quite successful project, .
