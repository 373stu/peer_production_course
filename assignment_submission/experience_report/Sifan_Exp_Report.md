## An Eye-Opening Book
The book [_Producing Open Source Software_](https://producingoss.com/) is really fascinating, author _Karl Fogel_ uses many analogies in this book, which is my favorite writing style, so translating it along with reading it is enjoyable for me.

## Gain the Privilege
Normally, translating a book is a privilege, and gaining the privilege often requires that you're professional in the certain field and fluent in both languages. Participating this book's translation team is no exception. I applied for this privilege by sending an email to the author _Karl Fogel_, and he set up my account and I can freely change my password but not the username, in other words, not everyone can register. That's strange, right? Usually, people hold the view that **open source** projects should be **open**, so that anyone can access and modify them. I had the same question until I commit my first contribution.

## Knife and Meat
Besides getting the translator account set up, in order to contribute, I need to learn the usage of [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org) and more importantly, the book is written in xml format, I ought to figure out the basic structure of these xml files. Nonetheless, these are easier than I thought.

## Why Am I Lazy?
Like I mentioned before, I really enjoy reading this book. However, translating is not as easy as reading.
