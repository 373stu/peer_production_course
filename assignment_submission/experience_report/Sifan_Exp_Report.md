## An Eye-Opening Book
The book [_Producing Open Source Software_](https://producingoss.com/) is really fascinating, author _Karl Fogel_ uses many analogies in this book, which is my favorite writing style, so translating it along with reading it is enjoyable for me.

## Gain the Privilege
Normally, translating a book is a privilege, and gaining the privilege often requires that you're professional in the certain field and fluent in both languages. Participating this book's translation team is no exception. I applied for this privilege by sending an email to the author _Karl Fogel_, and he set up my account and I can freely change my password but not the username, in other words, not everyone can register. That's strange, right? Usually, people hold the view that **open source** projects should be **open**, so that anyone can access and modify them. I had the same question until I commit my first contribution.

## Knife and Meat
Besides getting the translator account set up, in order to contribute, I need to learn the usage of [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org) and more importantly, the book is written in xml format, I ought to figure out the basic structure of these xml files. Nonetheless, these are easier than I thought.

## Enjoy the Cooking
To begin with, I checked the contribution history (you can check it [here](http://viewvc.red-bean.com/producingoss/trunk/?view=log)) to make sure whether or not I have teammates to cooperate with. If so, I can work on chapters that I already read. However, it turned out that I would fight alone, which makes it less fun. In spite of that, I thought I could finish the translation work myself, at least before version 3 (if there is). So, I chose to start from the acknowledge part of the book instead of focusing on a couple of chapters. Once I started my journey, I found translating is not as easy as reading and more often than not, it takes lots of time to come up with suitable words just for some idioms. Still, it's worthwhile especially when I made the first commit command and surprisingly, the Chinese version pages are updated accordingly without any confirmation, which is quite different from what I expected (the _pull request_ way). Till then, I knew why it's a privilege to be a translator in this open source project, that's for the convenience of commit command. The author _Karl Fogel_ is the "Benevolent Dictator"[1] here,

## Standing On the Shoulders of Giants


## Why Am I Lazy?
Like I mentioned before, I really enjoy reading this book. However, translating is not as easy as reading.
