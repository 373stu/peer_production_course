###Peer Production Participation Project: Community Identification
Instructor: Prof. Howison
Student: Sifan Guo

####Brief Introduction
As is indicated in its subtitle, _Producing Open Source Software_ is a book guiding us how to run a successful free software. Obviously, the author Karl Fogel himself follows what he proposed in this book and he takes full advantage of the benefits of open source by releasing the book under an open copyright (Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License).

What’s more, this book has 17 translations other than English for now, these 17 translation groups as well as the original English version contributors make up [this community](https://producingoss.com) that I'd like to talk about. As a community, all the members are enrolled in an email list. Whenever someone poses a question, anyone in the list can answer it. Moreover, using [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org) makes sure that everyone can freely modify others' work without concern of vandals.


####What Makes a Peer Production Community?  
Benkler mentioned three core characteristics of peer production, however, those characteristics are too broad to help us define a community. As far as I’m concerned, a peer production community should have (a) an open copyright license, (b) something to produce, and (c) contributions from multiple people--more than one person.

An open copyright license is the first key element of a peer production community. Usually copyright terms are too difficult to be understood for many people, whereas open copyright licenses are making themselves clear by the word **open**, so people don’t need to ask for permission whenever they want to modify others’ work. Besides, I consider asking for permission as part of collaboration costs, and the higher the collaboration costs, the lower the efficiency of a peer production community. Therefore, I believe an open copyright license is essential to a peer production community.

In addition, every community exists for a reason, more often than not, the reason is to produce something such as designing a software, writing a paper or simply generating some information. In other words, if the members of a certain community are only chatting random things, this community is absolutely not a peer production community.

Last but not least, more than one person should have contributions. If a community consists of a single person throughout its whole lifecycle, then it’s not a peer production community. However, a peer production community could consist of only one person in a certain period. Case in point, if the community is founded by a single person and as time goes by, some others come, contribute something and leave, few months later, there is only one person in this community for now, it’s still a peer production community because many people had contributions.

####Applying the Standards
First of all, this translation project is under Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License which is an open copyright license. Second, people in this community are either trying to translating the book _Producing Open Source Software_ into various languages or modifying the English version. Moreover, lots of people have been contributing to this project. Hence, I think this community belongs to peer production.
