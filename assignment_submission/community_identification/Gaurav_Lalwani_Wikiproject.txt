WikiProject: Databases

Scope/Goal

The main scope of the Wikiproject database community is to bring together people from 
different fields to share ideas that relate to the databases. The project aims to 
“tag all database-related articles”i in the {{WPDATABASE}} banner database. This 
community aims to use peer production techniques to curate articles that correspond to the 
databases. Since these articles belong to different background (eg mathematicians, software 
engineers etc), the community aims at getting help from people that excel in their respective 
backgrounds who can better perform the tasks.
WikiProject Versus Organizational forms
Normally organizational firms follow a certain methodology/approach such as waterfall to 
complete pending tasks. Wiki project follows the agile methodology to complete the pending 
tasks. The community has certain pending tasks that need to be completed and are listed in 
the form of sprints. Certain tasks that are completed need assessment. The articles and tasks 
are then assessed by different people involved in the community and given feedback thus 
extending the concept of improving someone else’s work. The assessment follows a pre-
defined rubric that grades articles on the basis of their importance and quality. The difference 
is that the projects don’t have certain SLA requirements or deadlines like in organizational 
firms.

Licenses/Terms

The community follows the creative Commons license agreement, a very important aspect of 
being a peer production community. The terms of this license state that people involved in the 
community are free “to share”ii the work of others. People are also free “to adapt”ii the work 
of others. Also all the rules can be compromised if one gets the permission from the 
copyright holder. This is similar to a peer production community where people continuously 
assess and try to improve upon the existing code/work.  The community follows strict 
copyright protocols where the users can’t sell the work of the community under their name. 
Peer production communities usually have strict copyright laws since many people are 
involved in the project and the final outcome is the result of the dedicated efforts of the entire 
community. The community follows a strict writing and citing rule as prescribed by the 
WikiProject Computer science/Manual of style. Thus the community follows the technique of 
peer production of adhering to certain norms so as to avoid the problem of version control 
among different users. One has to register for an account only when one makes public 
contributions. Thus the changes that account for public contributions will be titled, otherwise 
there is no way to determine the author of the changes. This community works on the same 
principle of peer production that it is difficult to find the identity of the person who evaluates 
your code/work or who improves upon the same. 

Motivations

When I reflect on my reasons for choosing this, I think that my motivation comes from the 
passion to learn more about databases. This is very important as people belonging to different 
backgrounds come together to share their work and learn about databases. This is very useful 
for beginners who wish to have an overview of the work involved in the field. Another 
important motivation is the feedback which leads to improvement in skills. ”Students learned 
more after providing elaborated feedback.”iii
