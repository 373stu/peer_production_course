# The community and product.

The peer production community that I will be contributing to is React-Bootstrap project [1] hosted on GitHub. The peer production community produces software products that work with Facebook's React project and help front-end developers with React optimized version of Twitter's Bootstrap project. The community produces six different products in the front-end landscape, the react-bootstrap project being the flagship product and the one to which I will be contributing.
 
# Why is this a peer production community?
The React-Bootstrap community is self-organizing community composed of sixteen official community members, non-members like myself also contribute to the projects. The project is licensed under MIT License [2], an is an example of a stereotypical Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects - which are one of the best known instances of peer production according to Benkler [3]. The project is centered around a group of core personalities who have PR merging and commit rights to the project, the project does not have an established governance model or documented procedures of any kind other than the usage documentation for the software products. Using Benkler's [3] three core characteristics of peer production.

1. Decentralization of conception and execution - Contibutors can open issues for new features, bugs, contribute code and even fork the project.
2. Harnessing diverse motivations - Contributors and members of the project do not have any common organizational affiliations, that the project is being worked on by diverse individuals and not directed by an organization, common obligation or monetary incentives.
3. Separation of governance and management from property and contract - The property, which is the software products are licensed under a vanilla MIT License and thus liberated from any terms of use. The governance and management of the project is a metritocratic model with certain central decision making figures - making it a benevolent dictatorship by committee.

The community of practice and key members.
The contributors and members of the project can be called a 'community of practice' [4], where the members share a common occupation of being software engineers. They further have commonalities in the technologies they use and problems that they solve as software workers. The comminity also harbours within itself a 'community of interest', these are GitHub users who are 'watching' or have 'starred' the project. These non-members and possibly non-contributors take interest in the project without necessarily contributing to it.

# How the community works.
The community follows the GitHub based FOSS community contribution model we seen in many GitHub hosted FOSS projects. A new contributor offers their time to a particular bug or an enhancement through comments, this is in part to claim an issue/work item and to informally introduce themselves to the project community. This is follwed by a pull request that is tested and merged by someone from the contributor team. Non-member non-contributors can and do file new issues with the project, these can be picked up by the peer producers. The core team can induct a new contributor in it if they see the contributor adding value to the preoject or being regularly engaed. 

# My participation.
I will be sending a pull request for fixing a bug in the react-bootstrap codebase or documentation. I am looking at one possible issue that is of my interest and which I think I am capable of fixing. [5]
