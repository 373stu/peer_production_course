## OpenStreetMap
OpenStreetMap is a global map showing routes, geography, and municipal features. OpenStreetMap shows reveals the same information as alternative applications: road names, highways, airports, parks, rivers, etc. Unlike other map apps, however, OpenStreetMap leverages community contributions to provide its best asset—it’s hyper-detailed information. For instance, by clicking the “query features” button, users can identify trash cans, covered railroad tracks, playgrounds, and more. 

## Making Edits
To make an edit, a logged in user clicks on a node (e.g. a building or rail line) and uses a form to revise or add to that node’s fields, tags, and relations. Fields are a limited number of fundamental details like the address, payment types accepted, and elevation. Tags and relations to other nodes/boundaries may be created at the editor’s discretion. When saving an edit, a brief description of the change is required.

## Community
New users are immediately made aware of OpenStreetMap’s basic vocabulary and mechanics. They are also informed that they “expect all participants to collaborate with, and communicate with, the community” (“OpenStreetMap,” n.d.).

Like in many peer production communities (Crowston, Wei, Howison, & Wiggins, 2012), such communication may occur through several synchronous and asynchronous channels. Documentation may be consulted or updated by visiting the OpenStreetMap wiki. Users may also post to forums or mailing lists organized by country and special topic like Garmin maps, hiking trails, and feature development. For immediate communication, users may turn to IRC chat. While some of these communication forums seem to have sporadic use (e.g. some forums have not been posted to in months), many are active. The plethora of communication methods and their consistent use indicates a healthy and active community. 

The forums are moderated by users, several of whom manage multiple forums. This additional responsibility undertaken by a small number of people reflects the classic pattern of core contributors supported by a larger number of occasional contributors (Crowston et al., 2012). There are about 3,000,000 occasional contributors to OpenStreetMap (“Join the community - OpenStreetMap Wiki,” 2017).

In contrast to the numerous communication channels, rules are relatively sparse; the expectation of communication is the only regulation told to new users. While users benefit from notes showing where potential edits may be needed and users may request that their changes are reviewed, there is no assigned work and no obvious supervision. Such autonomy is an essential characteristic of peer-production, establishing OpenStreetMap as a clear example of the model: geographically distributed users are encouraged to improve the product as they see fit on a schedule that meets their needs.

## Expectations

I expect that contributing to OpenStreetMap will be simple and intuitive. The extensive documentation answers all obvious questions and the ever-present “Edit” button on the map page makes contributing on-the-fly simple. The area around my home has been under construction for several years and OpenStreetMap allows for a high level of granularity, meaning that there should be plenty of changes to make and details to provide. As an alternative to local changes, I anticipate being able to contribute to community-wide efforts by finding an ongoing project in one of the forums.
