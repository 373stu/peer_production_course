# Community Identification Paper: Atom


Text editors are used by software developers, hobbyists, and programmers to write code and documentation quickly and easily. Text editors assist these developers in the task of writing code efficiently and effectively through various tools, such as text formatting, syntax highlighting, keyboard shortcuts, and other configuration and customization settings. Many text editors are developed, licensed, and released by various organizations and companies (e.g. Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Apple XCode, Apache Eclipse, etc.). However, a recent rise of peer production methodologies has influenced the development of text editors and has led to the release of a new and very popular text editor known as Atom.

Atom is a free and open source text editor that is developed and maintained by users on GitHub. Atom not only is developed as an open source project itself but also supports other open source plug-ins to the text editor and allows users to tie in other extending packages that are also built and maintained by the open source community. The Atom community consists of all individuals - software developers, hobbyists, programmers, and others - who have an interest in a fully customizable and configurable text editor that is built and maintained by its own users. As opposed to other text editors that are built by a large company or organization, Atom is not owned by any particular company or organization and has been released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.

The Atom project is a great example of a peer production project. Benkler, in his article Peer Production and Cooperation, defines “three dimensions” by which a peer production project or innovation can be identified: “decentralized conception and execution,” “diverse motivations,” and “organization separated from property and contract.” As previously explained, Atom is entirely developed and maintained by users on GitHub and was not conceived nor has not been executed by any centralized authority or entity. In addition, users of GitHub are not united by a single prize-centered, monetary, or corporation-centered motivation to develop and maintain Atom. Rather, the developers of Atom maintain a wide variety of motivations to develop and maintain Atom, including the motivation of pure enjoyment and leisure, the motivation of actually utilizing Atom as a text editor to write code, and the motivation of gaining experience and skill whilst developing and maintaining Atom. Lastly, there is no organization by means of contract for the Atom project. The Atom project is loosely organized through the contributions made by users on GitHub.

The Atom project on GitHub is similar to other GitHub projects in that users can fork the repository, make changes and alterations, and submit a pull request to request that their changes be added to the master repository. Contributions to the Atom project mainly include bug fixes, additions to documentation, addition and development of new features, and optimizations and improvements made to existing features and code. I am expecting to be able to peruse the “issues” listed on the Atom GitHub page to find one to three contributions that I can make to the code base. I am hoping to make at least one bug fix and have my fix be pulled into the master repository through a pull request.
