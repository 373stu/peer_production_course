##Peer Production Community Identification  
The community I choose to introduce is Steam Workshop. Steam Workshop is affiliated  to Steam, a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation (“Steam”, 2018). On Steam there are thousands of games and applications, and most of them have related Workshops. According to the official website of Steam Community, “the Steam Workshop is a central hub of player-created content and tools to publish, organize, and download that content into your games. Different games will utilize the Workshop in different ways” (“Steam Workshop”, 2018). 

##How it works  
Although each game on Steam utilizes Steam Workshop differently, they basically follow similar processes. Here I will take one game as the example, which is also what I decide to participate in. The game is called Dota 2, a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game. I won’t introduce a lot about the details of this game, because it will take thousands of words. But in short, in Dota 2 there’re many elements a player can customize. Character slots can be used to decorate the outward appearance of characters. Music packs can be used to change the background music of the game. Custom game can be used to design a new game mode with customized rules. And bot scripts can be used to optimize the operations of bots in a game.

Developers can first create a project, like a set of bot script, in local host. Steam provides an API to help them integrate Steam’ functions into their project (“Steam”, 2018). Then by submit it on Workshop, this project will be available to all of Dota 2 players. Anyone can get the content by subscribing the project. It’s open source and has a GNU licensing. The source code of the script is available on GitHub. Anyone can contribute on the project by making a pull request, and the developer will decide whether to adopt the modification. 

##Why it is Peer Production  
Benkler argued that peer production has three core characteristics: decentralized conception and execution; diverse motivations, including non-monetary motivations; governance separated from property and contract (Benkler, 2016).
I think Steam Workshop fit well with such characteristics:  
1. Anyone can give suggestions about how to improve the performance of bots, even if they don’t have skills of programming. And the main developer, as well as other contributors can execute such conceptions.
2. People who take part in Workshop do have diverse motivations. Some for money because great projects can make profit in Workshop. Others may want to enrich programing experience. And a lot of people just want the bots to be more powerful so they can better enjoy the game.
3. The third one is not very obvious in this case.   
Moreover, it’s open source, which is one of the characteristics of peer production.

##My expectation about participation    
I decided to contribute to one of the bot script projects of Dota 2. It’s called Ranked Matching AI, which is the best among all of Dota 2 bot scripts with more than one million subscribers. Yet it still has so many defections and bugs. I have contacted with the main developer. What I expect is to make some updates to it via pull requests, making the bots have better performance that the current version.
