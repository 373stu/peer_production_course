hello everyone,

Lets see how this thing works.

1. P1 creates a file and adds text and commits
2. P1 pushes to origin and creates a PR
3. PR is merged
4. P2 and P3 pull upstream
5. P2 edits the first line of the file and commits
6. P2 pushes to origin and creates a PR
7. P2's PR is merged
8. P3 edits the first line of the file differently from P2 and commits
9. P3 pulls from upstream. 
10. A merge conflict is produced
