Introduction
Open source communities are predicated on the notion that they give space to any users or groups who want to 
collaborate on a project. Distributed and decentralized workspaces such as GitHub service those who may be 
geographically dispersed or hold varying degrees of technological skill. While all open source projects contend 
with a variety of factors, including the two aforementioned, they all begin with a basic motivation for the project. Members of these projects find themselves drawn to virtual work either through intrinsic or extrinsic motivations, collaborating either for the greater social good or for their own personal benefit.

In recent years, two groups of open source communities have dedicated their efforts to serving the Spanish 
speaking community in the United States and Latin America. Despite being the second most spoken language in 
both the U. S. and internationally, Spanish speakers remain a highly underserved population. This paper will 
look at Latin and Latinx open source communities that service Spanish speakers and examine their helping 
behaviors and motivations for doing so.

Char.la
Announced via a Medium post on October 12, 2016, Char.la was, in part, a monthly meetup series aimed at 
furthering the technical programming knowledge of the Spanish speaking community (Buriticá, 2016). Created 
by four Latin American programmers, Juan Pablo Buriticá, Nicolle Jiménez, Julián Duque and David Avellaneda, 
the meetups were established to address three main problems:

1. Bleeding edge and advanced content is typically in English only.
2. The low density of specialized technologists who can share their experience.
3. The limited exposure to deep technical problems and solutions in the region.

The Char.la team, who named their project after the Spanish word “to chat” – utilizing the ‘.la’ of the 
Latin American internet – knew each other previously from their work developing programming meetups and 
community software conferences in Colombia (Buriticá, 2016). These events were initially Buriticá’s idea, 
after the software developer attended a talk by Foursquare CTO Harry Heymann titled “Escalating Foursquare 
with MongoDB” in 2010 (Buriticá, 2016). Though Buriticá was inspired by Heymann’s speech, his main takeaway 
from the event was that he was only privy to such knowledge and tech personalities because he was living in 
New York City at the time (Buriticá, 2015; Buriticá, 2016). Within a few short months, Buriticá enlisted the 
help of a handful of Colombian-based developers and the group went on to launch community software conferences, 
BogotaConf 2011, BogotaConf 2012 and JSConf 2013 (Buriticá, 2015; Buriticá, 2016; Buriticá, 2019).

While the conferences were successful, Buriticá and the rest of the Colombian developer team
felt that further work was required to advance the Latin American technologist community
(Buriticá 2016). As a whole, Latinx representation within major tech companies is staggeringly
low – with Google, Twitter, Facebook and Amazon each reporting less than 3.5% of Latinx
representation in technical roles (Molla, 2018; Kapor Center, 2018). While finer statistics about
the breakdown between Latinx programmers born in the United States versus those from Latin
America are unknown, anecdotal evidence points to the likelihood that fewer Latin Americans
are hired due to a lack of educational content (Buriticá 2016; Kapor Center, 2018). Platforms
that do exist to teach Spanish and bilingual speakers technical programming languages are
typically subscription based (i.e. Platzi) or targeted towards beginners (i.e. Oja.la).

The Char.la team decided to establish a free, open source community to increase the volume of
Spanish and bilingual content for Latin technologists (Buriticá, 2016). In his announcement of
the project, Buriticá sent out a call for action to the LatAm developer community – requesting
that people join the project to learn and help mentor others (Buriticá, 2016). The Medium post
directed readers to Char.la’s Twitter account, @quecharla, where participants found additional
instructions on how to get involved with the project (Buriticá, 2016; Buriticá, 2019).

According to Buriticá, the structure for Char.la, a combination of Dropbox, GitHub and YouTube,
was based off of a combination of personal experience with the platforms and previous
organizing work (Buriticá, 2019). The Char.la team decided it would be best to have community
members present technical talks supplemented with slides and documentation. For the
technical presentations, Buriticá and his team decided to livestream the talks via YouTube and
asked three developers to present on a topic for twenty minutes once a month. Tasks were
semi-self-assigned, with volunteers submitting propuestas (or proposals) for a topic they
wished to present on to the Char.la organizers. With regards to the duration of the talks,
Buriticá remarked, “In our experience we know that talks are too long. And for new speakers
it’s too hard for them to synthesize the information without structure. Twenty minutes forces
you to only cover the main points” (Buriticá, 2019).

In 2017 work on Char.la was temporarily suspended due to collaborator issues (Buriticá, 2019).
One organizer moved to Germany, another to the United States and the time differences
became increasingly difficult. Buriticá personally felt the need for the group to focus more of
their efforts on JSConf Colombia, the Colombian JavaScript conference that the Char.la
founders launched in 2013 (Buriticá, 2019). With regards to Char.la, Buriticá’s believes that the
project needs to find a new organizing team, but is optimistic that the endeavor can relaunch
before 2020 (Buriticá, 2019).

Proyecto Casa Blanca
In January 2017, just days after the presidential inauguration, the Trump administration
removed all Spanish-language content from its official website, whitehouse.gov (González,
2017; Persio, 2017; Thomsen, 2018). Unlike previous administrations, beginning with President
George W. Bush, who offered full Spanish-language versions of the White House website for
the 37.5 million Spanish speakers in the United States, the new administration eliminated all Spanish 
and bilingual media – offering little information to visitors. In its place were two
sentences: “Thank you for your interest in this subject. Stay tuned as we continue to update
whitehouse.gov” (Wenzke, 2017; Silva, 2017; Persio, 2017).


On January 29, 2017, four days following the removal of these pages, a group of Latinx
programmers launched an initiative to make the content from on whitehouse.gov available to
the Spanish speaking community (Proyecto CasaBlanca, 2017; Silva, 2017). David Silva, an
undocumented Columbian JavaScript developer and cofounder of the nonprofit organization
Techqueria, enlisted members of his community to translate content on from the White House
website to a new home, http://proyectocasablanca.com/. In his Medium post, “Proyecto Casa
Blanca – Make the WhiteHouse in Spanish Again,” Silva explained that Techqueria, an
organization of Latinx in tech, had decided to create their own version of the White House
website in Spanish (Silva, 2017). While community members were already working on
translating content from English to Spanish, Silva sought contributors who could help improve
the new site’s design and SEO and ensure the validity of the content (Silva, 2017). The team’s
goal was to create Spanish content until the government reestablished an official version of the
White House website.

According to Silva, contributors focused first on Executive Orders issued by Trump, believing
that these documents posed an imminent threat to the Latinx community. For many of those
contributing, the removal of the information felt like an imminent threat. Per Silva, “Given that
all of those documents and Executive Decisions greatly affected the Latino community we
believed that it was very important to republish them in a way so that people could follow what
was going on. With Trump’s attempts to destroy DACA, TPS, attempts to thwart immigration,
talking about the wall and funding. Banning Latinos and Muslims, things like that so we started
doing the work.”

Given that Techqueria had an established community of technologists, the organizers found the
decision regarding platform selection to be a given. “We decided to use GitHub because it’s the
most popular tool for collaborating and open source. We had an open source community within
the site where anyone could submit translations for the website and we created tools that
would track which pages had been translated and who was working on what. Some of the
pages were very long and they used a lot of legalese that we weren’t super familiar with, so it
was a lot of work to translate each one of them – at least several hours per page, especially the
Executive Decisions. But every time a new Executive Decision was published, we would
translate it as soon as possible and post it” (Silva, 2019). With regards to the technical aspect of
the work, the team created space for non-technical volunteer. “We had some volunteers that
would just help with the translating, for instance putting the text into a Google Doc from the
White House website, or who were members of our Slack and they would give us feedback on
the quality of the translations” (Silva, 2019).

Silva and his counterparts worked on Proyecto Casa Blanca for about a month until they found
out that there was a “different nonprofit had a project that had a ton more volunteers that had
a (similar) project and they were doing a great job” (Silva, 2019). Transfluent, a professional 
translation agency, ran a GoFundMe campaign in February 2017 to raise funds for their Spanish
replication of the White House website; but did not meet their $30,000 goal, receiving just
$4,385 in pledges (La Casa Blanca, n.d.; Milanes, 2017; Penttinen, 2017). The group did
establish LaCasaBlanca.com, a semi-functional site with a Spanish landing page that links to the
standard English version of whitehouse.gov (La Casa Blanca, n.d.).

As of October 2019, the White House has yet to reinstate a Spanish version of the official White
House website at whitehouse.gov (Boddiger, 2018; Thomsen, 2018). The administration does
maintain a Twitter presence at @LaCasaBlanca, however, this account is updated far less often
than its English language counterpart, @WhiteHouse. In the first six months of
@LaCasaBlanca’s existence, forty-one tweets were sent – with just twenty-one of them offering
original Spanish content, as opposed to simply retweeting English tweets (Persio, 2017). At the
same time, in his first six months of office, Donald Trump tweeted approximately 1,002 times
from the official presidential Twitter account – an average of 5.5 tweets per day (Galluci, 2017).
Outside of Twitter, the President and the White House do not promote alternative Spanish
social media presences. In contrast, the White House maintains an official presence on
Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Snapchat and YouTube.

Synthesis
For leaders of both Char.la and Proyecto Casa Blanca, motivation to organize and execute their
projects originated from an inherent desire to help their Latin American and Latinx
communities. The recognition that others need to be helped, or attention, is the first condition
in Schwartz and Howard’s self-based motivational model in helping behavior (Crowston &
Fagnot, 2017). From here, members of each group faced an impetus to respond – arising out of
their sense of social obligation. In personal interviews conducted with Buriticá and Silva, both
individuals spoke of the responsibility they felt to provide a service to their community. Buriticá
was driven by the desire to spread advanced technical knowledge and increase Latin
representation in the tech field, in line with the “each one, bring one” mentality (Buritcá, 2019).
In a related fashion, Silva felt an obligation to protect the Latinx community through sharing
information (Silva, 2019).

Per Schwartz and Howard’s motivational model, the third condition, evaluation, individuals
weigh the obligation and capacity of helping against the social and tangible costs of doing so
(Crowston & Fagnot, 2017). Given this step, it’s necessary to consider what is actually gained
from and risked by these two open source communities. In regards to Char.la, the cost for the
organizers is largely related to the time spent managing the project – corralling speakers and
information into the right channels. No financial cost incurred and, ultimately, the entire Latin
American community wins when one of them thrives due to the spread of economic wealth and
knowledge. With Proyecto Casa Blanca, the experience is somewhat similar, in that volunteers
are not financially responsible for the endeavor and that the goal is to spread knowledge. The
project differs, however, due to its critical temporal element and the danger the work poses to
the undocumented members of the open source community. Despite their differences,
members of each community are motivated to take on this work because they inherently
believe it is for the greater good. As Buriticá noted, “If you are in a position to support
communities by speaking, organizing, or sponsoring: Do so. You might change someone’s life.”
